## Installation
The pertinent files for the project, including this README can all be found in the Github repository located at: https://github.com/mhalder4/note-taker-challenge. The website can be found at the Heroku address that follows: https://mhalder-note-taker-challenge-5cda22b36b1b.herokuapp.com/.
## Usage
Along the left of the webpage, there are all the existing notes along with a trash can button to delta a note if desired. Upon clicking on a note, the contents pop up on the right side of the screen where they can be edited. A plus sign in the upper right can also be used to create a new note with blank entry fields. Upon editing a new or existing note, a save button in the upper right can be clicked to save the note to the database. A note can only be saved if both text fields have text in them.
